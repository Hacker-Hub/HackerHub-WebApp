# HackerHub_WebApp
The HackerHub website but in a web application form for Windows, macOS, and Linux.  

[X] Please note that at this time this can only be executed on an Intel-based Mac running macOS 10.9+ . 

This was all made possible by [nativefier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativefier) an NPM application that can convert websites to local web applications that can be executed on macOS, Windows, and most Linux Distributions.
